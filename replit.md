# Lua Deobfuscation Project

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Lua deobfuscation tool system specifically designed for Termux (Android). The project successfully desobfuscated an obfuscated Lua game file and created professional-grade tools for processing similar files.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Language preference: Spanish (español)
Platform: Termux on Android

## System Architecture

This project has evolved from a single obfuscated Lua file to a comprehensive deobfuscation toolkit for Termux:

### Core Architecture
- **Platform**: Termux (Android terminal emulator)
- **Language**: Python 3.11 for deobfuscation tools
- **Target**: Lua script processing and deobfuscation
- **Deployment**: Command-line tools for mobile development

### Tools Developed
- **Basic Deobfuscator**: Core functionality for string decoding and formatting
- **Advanced Deobfuscator**: Complete processing with comprehensive reporting
- **Documentation**: Full user guide and installation instructions

### Recent Changes (July 9, 2025)
- ✅ Successfully deobfuscated inkgame.lua (1,158 strings processed)
- ✅ Created two-tier deobfuscation system (basic + advanced)
- ✅ Generated comprehensive documentation for Termux users
- ✅ Implemented professional reporting system
- ✅ Added Spanish language support

## Key Components

### Main Script (`inkgame.lua`)
- Contains encoded string literals representing game logic
- Uses hexadecimal character encoding (\074, \055, etc.)
- Implements a function that returns an executable module
- Likely contains game state management, rendering, and input handling when decoded

### Code Structure
- **String Tables**: Multiple encoded string literals containing game data
- **Function Wrapper**: Main function that processes and executes the encoded content
- **Character Encoding**: Uses octal escape sequences for obfuscation

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Script loads and decodes string literals
2. **Execution**: Decoded content is processed and executed
3. **Game Loop**: Likely contains standard game loop patterns (update, render, input)
4. **State Management**: Game state is managed through the decoded module

## External Dependencies

- **Lua Runtime**: Requires Lua interpreter (version not specified)
- **Potential Graphics Library**: May depend on LÖVE 2D, Corona SDK, or similar Lua game framework
- **Operating System**: Platform-specific requirements depend on the target runtime

## Deployment Strategy

### Current State
- Single Lua file deployment
- Obfuscated source code for protection
- Minimal file structure suggests embedded or standalone execution

### Recommendations
- **Development**: Would benefit from deobfuscation for maintenance
- **Testing**: Need to identify target Lua runtime environment
- **Distribution**: Current format suitable for protected distribution
- **Debugging**: Obfuscation makes debugging challenging

### Potential Improvements
- **Source Control**: Consider maintaining unobfuscated version separately
- **Documentation**: Add comments and documentation for development version
- **Modular Structure**: Break down into multiple files for better organization
- **Build Process**: Implement build system to generate obfuscated version from clean source

## Technical Notes

The current implementation prioritizes code protection over maintainability. For development purposes, it would be beneficial to:

1. Identify the obfuscation method used
2. Create a deobfuscation process for development
3. Establish a build pipeline for generating protected versions
4. Document the game's actual functionality and architecture

This structure suggests the application is a complete game packaged as a single executable Lua script, common in mobile game development or embedded Lua environments.
